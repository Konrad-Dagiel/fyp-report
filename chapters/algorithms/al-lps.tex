    \item[Problem Statement:]
        Given a string, return the length of the longest subsequence\footnote{Subsequences do not have to be continuous.} of the string which is a palindrome\footnote{A palindrome is a string which is identical to itself when reversed (Example: "racecar").}.
    
    \item[Input:]
        A string $s$.
        
    \item[Output:]
        An integer $lps$ which represents the longest palondromic subsequence of $s$.
        
    \item[Example:] For:\\
        $s = "babbb"$\\
        $lps = 4$
        
    \item[Explanation:]
        $"bbbb"$ is the longest palindromic subsequence of $s$. It has length $4$.
\end{description}

\subsection{Tabulation Approach to Longest Palindromic Subsequence}
This problem is simply a special case of Longest Common Subsequence.
The longest palindromic subsequence of $s$ is simply the longest common subsequence of $s$ and $reverse(s)$.
Therefore the same logic applies. See Section \ref{section:lcs}.

A sample python implementation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:lps-dp}.
For the implementation of the lcs subroutine, see Figure \ref{fig:lcs-dp}.
