\chapter*{Abstract}
The outcome of this project is a self-contained, complete guide to dynamic programming which can 
be accessed by anyone online. The text serves to take a programmer with zero dynamic 
programming experience and give them a deep understanding of the topic, providing them with
enough comprehensive knowledge to solve dynamic programming problems on their own.
This project also proposes solutions to two new dynamic programming problems, The Interstellar Problem I and The Interstellar Problem II.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Dynamic Programming was originally proposed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s.
In Bellman's dynamic programming, problems are typically represented using states, actions, and transitions between states.
Each state represents a specific configuration or situation in the problem domain, and actions define the possible decisions or choices that can be made from each state.
This representation allows for a more structured approach to problem-solving and optimization.
Throughout this notebook when we refer to Dynamic Programming, we refer to a more general, modernized version of Dynamic Programming.
