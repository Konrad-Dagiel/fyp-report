\chapter*{Abstract}
This is a research project on the dynamic programming method.
Starting with no previous experience, the task was to study the dynamic programming method and understand it deeply enough to be able to teach it to an average undergraduate computer science student.
The outcome of this project is a self-contained, complete guide to dynamic programming which can be accessed by anyone online.
The guide serves to take a programmer with zero dynamic programming experience and give them a deep understanding of the topic,
providing them with enough comprehensive knowledge to solve dynamic programming problems on their own.
This project also proposes several optimizations to existing dynamic programming algorithms,
as well as solutions to two new dynamic programming problems, The Interstellar Problem I and The Interstellar Problem II.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Dynamic Programming was originally proposed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s.
In Bellman's dynamic programming, problems are typically represented using states, actions, and transitions between states.
Each state represents a specific configuration or situation in the problem domain, and actions define the possible decisions or choices that can be made from each state \cite{bellman1954theory}.
This representation allows for a more structured approach to problem-solving and optimization.
Throughout this notebook when we refer to Dynamic Programming, we refer to a more general, modernized version of Dynamic Programming.
